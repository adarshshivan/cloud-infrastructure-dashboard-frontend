# ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure Dashboard  

## Author: Adarsh Shivan
## Part of: CloudOps Suite

### 🚀 Overview  
The **Cloud Infrastructure Dashboard** is a simulated cloud monitoring web application that visualizes AWS resource data (like EC2 instances and S3 buckets) through a clean, modern interface.  

This project replicates how real cloud infrastructure dashboards work — built using **AWS, Python, Linux, and DevOps tools**, and deployed seamlessly on **Vercel** for live interaction.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes  
🔹 Learn to extract AWS resource data using **AWS CLI** and organize it as JSON.  
🔹 Understand **IAM roles & permissions** for secure access.  
🔹 Develop a fully functional **frontend visualization** using HTML, CSS, and JS.  
🔹 Practice **cloud-based DevOps workflows** (resource creation, automation, cleanup).  
🔹 Deploy and maintain your project using **GitHub + Vercel**.

## 🧾 About the Data  

> ⚙️ **Simulated AWS Data for Demonstration**
>  
> The data used in this dashboard is **real AWS output** collected through the AWS CLI and saved locally as `real_dashboard_data.json`.  
> This JSON file replaces mock data to show accurate AWS-like details such as:
> - EC2 Instance ID, Type, State, and Public IP  
> - S3 Bucket Name and Region  
>
> This design gives your portfolio a realistic *cloud monitoring* touch without requiring live AWS credentials.
